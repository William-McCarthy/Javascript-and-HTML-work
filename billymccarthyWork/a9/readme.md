#Originally, I was going to create a mask like two face, from Batman. Both sides of the mask would change color, allowing the creation of a decent mask. After messing around with this idea for awhile, I decided that I should make the mask mean something. To do this, I created a two face mask, both of a different hue, one happy colors, like red, yellow, orange, and one of sadder colors, blue, purple, and green. I decided to add something to distinguish them, as sometimes you may want more of a happier mask, so I created a way to make one side more transparent then the other, indicating it is not as important. Lastly, I made the hands black, to show they are tools, with transparency to show how usefull they are to you. The eye colors was just for fun.
