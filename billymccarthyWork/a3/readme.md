#Clear clears the screen to white
#black clear clears the screen to black, and the color of the three tools change
#for shapes, it draws shape emojis similar to garland. One of the main differences, is the color of the background
# affects which shapes are drawn.
#squarebase draws a square where depending on where you click, different vertexes are affected. it fills, so to truly
#create the square, you must click in opposite corners. as you drag, a new background is created.
#bezier creates a bezier line, where you affect the control points. As it is painted on only making it larger will truly affect the control points.
#smudge still works as Kate Compton created it to. I like how it interacted with the black canvas, and chose not to change it
